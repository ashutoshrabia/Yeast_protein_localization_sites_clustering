## This repo presents an analysis of yeast protein localization sites using clustering techniques. The primary objective is to determine the optimal number of clusters and evaluate different clustering models based on silhouette score, Calinski Harabasz score, and Davies-Bouldin score. Various preprocessing techniques and clustering algorithms were implemented to achieve the best results.
